# Museum or gallery visit, talk, or meetup

During the course of this semester, each student will attend a social gathering or event of your choice (e.g. museum or gallery opening, [meetup](http://meetup.com), talk, etc.) to gain ideas and/or conduct research for your creative process project or your future dystopia / utopia project. Write a brief description of the experience on your process website and describe how it relates to your creative process project and dystopia / utopia project ideas and/or research.
