**Course Prerequisites:** None

**Course Description**

In this class, the creative process will be investigated in order to generate ideas for art, design, technology, and business endeavors. The course will show how ideation, design research &amp; thinking, and prototyping can inspire, inform, and bring depth to what one ultimately creates. Students will expand their arsenal of design research skills, learn how to think critically about their audience, content, form, and processes, as well as, understand the importance of utilizing more than one research and design strategy.

**Program Goals**

The following Integrated Digital Media program goals are introduced and reinforced within this course. Students will:

*   develop conceptual thinking skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
*   develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
*   develop critical thinking skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historical, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
*   develop collaboration skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

**Course Objectives**

To get students to:

*   develop a rigorous, iterative process for looking, questioning, thinking, making, and communicating that challenges assumptions and preconceived ideas
*   use their imagination to create something entirely new &amp; innovative OR to reinvent an old idea into something new
*   introduce students to the many research &amp; design methodologies available to them
*   develop skills of description, research, analysis, visualization, design and critical thinking.
*   improve writing, documentation, and presentation skills
*   facilitate collaboration

**Course Outcomes**

By the end of this course students should be able to:

*   to search and spot ideas, and transform these invisible ideas into visible realizations

**Course Requirements** 

Participation is paramount to your success in this course. Be sure to log into NYU Classes and Slack multiple times a week, read all announcements, complete all Active Learning Modules* and assignments on time, and participate in Discussion Forums and Virtual Meetings.

_Consult with NYU Tandon Online for further details about Active Learning Modules._

**Course Structure**

This course is conducted entirely online, which means you do not have to be on campus to complete any portion of it. You will participate in the course using NYU Classes located at https://newclasses.nyu.edu and Slack. 

The course will be comprised of lectures, critiques, discussions, readings, screenings, exercises, projects, and a collaborative research paper.

Critiques are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. The class analyzes and suggests ways to increase the impact of your project. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your critique notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand what you are doing to make your project better. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project.

There will be discrete team and individual exercises and projects that require you to apply the tools, techniques, and methods presented in the lectures, discussions, readings, and other material. These fundamentals are organized according to five phases:

**Phase 1: Discovery / Inspiration**

*   Seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, smelling, feeling
*   Collecting, obsessing, hoarding

**Phase 1: Discovery / Inspiration: Steal Like An Artist**

*   Reappropriating, remixing

**Phase 2: Research / Ideation / Brainstorming**

*   Asking and listening
*   Visual researching
*   Materials researching
*   User / audience researching and ethnographic researching
*   Systems researching
*   Activity researching
*   Primary researching
*   Scholarly researching
*   Brainstorming, gamestorming, ideation

**Phase 3: Design / Sketching / Mapping**

*   Visualizing, drawing, sketching
*   Planning and mapping
*   Grouping, clustering, comparing, contrasting
*   Organizing and designing
*   Reorganizing and redesigning
*   Shaping and forming
*   Discerning and revealing
*   Connecting and disconnecting

**Phase 4: Prototyping**

*   Making, building, creating
*   Rapid prototyping
*   Iterating
*   Selecting and editing
*   Breaking then repeating all of the above

**Phase 5: Positioning / Pitching**

*   Framing and positioning
*   Storytelling, engaging, communicating, selling

**Evaluation &amp; Grading**

*   All work assigned will be completed and delivered on the due date, otherwise you will receive a failing grade for that assignment. In other words, late work will not be accepted.
*   Makeup assignments are only available when discussed with and approved by the instructor in advance of the due date.
*   Each student will be judged on the application of the ideas and concepts introduced during the course. Incomplete or unsatisfactory work will receive a failing grade.

**Grading**

Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative &amp; qualitative rubrics:

_Quantitative Overview_

Your grade for the course will be based on the following:

*   5% [Self Assessments](self_assessments.md) (2.5% each)
*   5% [Input Map](input_map.md)
*   5% [Narrative Timeline of Influences](narrative_timeline.md)
*   5% [Museum or gallery visit, talk, or meetup](visit_talk_meetup.md)
*   10% [Notebook or Sketchbook](notebook_or_sketchbook.md)
*   12% [Constant Input Choices](constant_input_choices.md)
*   14% [Process Website](process_website.md)
*   16% [Future Dystopia / Utopia Project](future.md)
*   28% [Creative Process Research Paper and Video Documentary](creative_process.md)

_Grading Overview_

*   **A Excellent** (Work of exceptional quality; Exceeds Expectations)
*   **A- Very Good** (Work of high quality)
*   **B+ Good** (Solid work; Meets Expectations)
*   **B Satisfactory** (Good work; Satisfies course requirements)
*   **B- Needs Improvement** (Below average work)
*   **C+ Poor Work** (Well Below Average)
*   **C Inadequate** (Less than adequate work)
*   **F Unacceptable** (The performance and/or attendance of the student has failed course requirements.)

**Learning Time for NYU Tandon Online Courses**

The New York State guidelines for online courses require the course to measure learning time. This should not be confused with lecture hours. Learning time is based upon required credit hours. Example: A three (3) credit course must have three (3) hours of learning time. 
Learning Time shall include, but is not limited to:
* Reviewing lecture videos/audio (including interactive lectures);
* Participating in online discussions (both asynchronous* and synchronous**);
* Group meetings and presentations;
* Assessments such as high-stakes assessments (midterms, finals, projects, labs, etc.) and low-stakes assessments (quizzing, homework, projects, labs, etc.); and,
* Any other task normally completed during an in-class session.

Important: Learning Time does not reflect reading time of supplemental information or textbook required reading. It also does not include high-stakes assessments such as take-home projects or assignments. It should, however, be included if the high-stakes assessment, like a final exam, is taken with a remote proctor and requires a student to be “online” during a specific time to complete the exam.

*   *   1.  Introduction: The School of Engineering encourages academic excellence in an environment that promotes honesty, integrity, and fairness, and students at the School of Engineering are expected to exhibit those qualities in their academic work. It is through the process of submitting their own work and receiving honest feedback on that work that students may progress academically. Any act of academic dishonesty is seen as an attack upon the School and will not be tolerated. Furthermore, those who breach the School’s rules on academic integrity will be sanctioned under this Policy. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the School’s Policy on Academic Misconduct.
        2.  Definition: Academic dishonesty may include misrepresentation, deception, dishonesty, or any act of falsification committed by a student to influence a grade or other academic evaluation. Academic dishonesty also includes intentionally damaging the academic work of others or assisting other students in acts of dishonesty. Common examples of academically dishonest behavior include, but are not limited to, the following:
            *   1.  Cheating: intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized notes, books, electronic media, or electronic communications in an exam; talking with fellow students or looking at another person’s work during an exam; submitting work prepared in advance for an in-class examination; having someone take an exam for you or taking an exam for someone else; violating other rules governing the administration of examinations.
                2.  Fabrication: including but not limited to, falsifying experimental data and/or citations.
                3.  Plagiarism: intentionally or knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one’s own in any academic exercise; failure to attribute direct quotations, paraphrases, or borrowed facts or information.
                4.  Unauthorized collaboration: working together on work that was meant to be done individually.
                5.  Duplicating work: presenting for grading the same work for more than one project or in more than one class, unless express and prior permission has been received from the course instructor(s) or research adviser involved.
                6.  Forgery: altering any academic document, including, but not limited to, academic records, admissions materials, or medical excuses.
